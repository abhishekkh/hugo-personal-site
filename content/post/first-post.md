I have always wanted to write a blog but never actually found the time or energy to do this. It feels great to finally be able to carve out some time and publish my view on different topics I care about. Again these are just my opinions and not meant to harm anyone.

I came to the United States as a student pursuing my Masters :mortar_board: in August 2004. I can't believe that it's been 16 years now. During this time, I have managed to graduate, live in New York(Jersey city technically!), Bay Area and now in Austin, TX where I live :house_with_garden: with my wife and 2 kids. Throughout this time I have worked as software engineer :computer: including spending 11 years in Paypal. That warrants its own blog post :smile:

Settling down in Austin was one of the best decision I have made financially and also because its a great place to raise your family. One of the stories that I have to tell is the side effect of living mostly a sedentary life style as a software engineer. Over the years I managed to put on 200+ pounds until the day came in 2018 when I decided enough is enough and I had to start taking better care of my health. Having little children definitely plays a part in this self-realization. More of that journey in another blog post.

Thats it for today and there's _more to come_.
