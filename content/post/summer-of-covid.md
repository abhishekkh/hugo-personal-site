title: "Summer of Covid & how we beat it"
---
Texas is known for 2 things - the bbq :poultry_leg: and Texas summer heat :grimacing:. Temperatures reach 100F pretty regularly, in fact the first year when I moved to Austin we had 100 days of 100F weather. On the plus side the waters in the pool, lake is nice and warm and thats how Texans usually beat the summer :snowflake: 

Its not unusual for kids day cares to have multiple splash pad days during the week and my kids were dying to enter the public pools. Unfortunately due to COVID :mask: we decided to keep them away from the pools. But with that we had to make some alternate arrangements - _setup an inflatable pool with water toys_ :sunglasses:. Kids loved the pool and it made this texas heat bearable. It also was a good way to spend the weekend, letting us all cool down and burn off some energy.

> Where do I find a pool :scream:?

Having decided on getting this pool, I started researching on amazon and was shocked at the price gouging going on. Usual price for an Intex inflatable pool was around $29.99 but amazon third party sellers were selling it for around **$180.00**. This was also about a week before the Memorial day weekend when summer officially starts. After looking for a few days I was finally able to find one on walmart for about $39.99 :heavy_check_mark:. Apart from the pool, I also needed a few things to maintain the pool throughout the summer.

Below is the list of things you will need and their links:

I had one handy which came with an old inflatable mattress we had.
- Patio furniture cover/tarp to cover the pool after each use. I had one lying around which I use for the patio furniture before spring(to avoid that green layer of pollen)
- Small chlorine [dispenser](https://www.amazon.com/ATIE-PoolSupplyTown-Floating-Chlorine-Dispenser/dp/B007NQTY5Q/ref=sr_1_5?crid=YRR9BF046M2S&dchild=1&keywords=1+inch+chlorine+floater+for+small+pool&qid=1599075536&sprefix=1+inch+chlrine+floater%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-5)
- 1 inch chlorine [tablets](https://www.amazon.com/Clorox-29005CLX-XtraBlue-Chlorinating-Tablets/dp/B084GQ8X97/ref=asc_df_B084GQ8X97/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459693136064&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17934475402131674302&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028284&hvtargid=pla-944096258761&psc=1)

- Old towels or something soft to add as a base for the pool. Mine was setup on area with pea gravel and hence this was needed to avoid any leaks
- Pool cleaning [net](https://www.amazon.com/Sunnyglade-Swimming-Supplies-Professional-Cleaning/dp/B07D8JJ5ZT/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=pool+cleaner+net&qid=1599076008&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFPVlc5TlhOVkFFMVUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA4NjQyNDEzU0ZIU05PN1IzRFc4JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTM2MjdHMk5DWEFKVTlQNlgmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) to pickup any leaves and debris from usage at the bottom of the pool.

I only changed the water once every 4-6 weeks and added a new chlorine pill every Sunday after the weekend use. Other than that I have had no other maintenace to be done on it and never had any algae to worry about. Cost of all the above items should be less than $100 but it was the best 100 dollars I have ever spent :smile:.
